super anxious
transcript
hello, my friend. i know that you are in a place of
anxiety right now, and i know how scary that is, and
i'm here for you and you're not alone. and you've
80t my full support right here, right now.
just start by taking a deep breath and i'm 80in8
to give you a practice that will help soothe your
nervous system and relax you. so as you breathe
in deeply and exhale completely, i have a simple
practice and all it involves is just tapping on your
hand. and it's a specific energy meridian called
the gamut point. it's between your pinky finger and
your ring finger, just below the knuckles. gently tap
on the gamut point while breathing in and letting
start tapping with me now. if you're not driving and
you're comfortable, close your eyes and just tap
with me on that gamut point.
breathing in, breathe out.

breathe in, breathe out, and say this out loud with
me, or say it to yourself silently as you tap, "i am
safe. i am safe. i am safe."
keep breathing gently. release that breath. continue I
to tap. i am safe. i am safe.
breathing in deeply, tapping and exhale
completely, connecting to your breath, affirming
your mantra, i am safe. i am safe.
now, take a deep breath in. put your hand on
your heart, your other hand on your belly, and let
that breath 80. take another deep breath in and
release. feel any release or relaxation in your body
and notice it. continue to breathe deeply and
exhale completely. you're safe in this moment.
you can always return to this practice. you're not
alone. take this peace with you wherever you 80
today.
