so you saw this message about avoiding temptation
and just really stopping yourself in the tracks and
you said, "yeah, gabby, i need that." so here we
are. we all have a drug of choice, whether it's a
drink, whether it's texting, that guy we know doesn't
like us, whatever it is that we might do, this is the
solution. i want you to play out the entire scene in
your head.
so you pick up the drink and you get the ball rolling,
and then what happens next? maybe you find
yourself in a bar. now you are out till four o'clock in
the morning. you don't remember where you were,
you wake up hung over. you get to work late, play
the entire process out. see it through to the end.
