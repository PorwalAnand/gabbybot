can't make a decision
transcnpt
so my friend, you can't make a decision right now.
that sucks. i hate that. that was a big issue for me
for so many years.
here's the deal. the ruminating and the
overthinking is not helping you. we need to make
decisions often from a place of a guttural knowing,
a sense of truth within ourselves. and the fastest
way to Ft to that decision is to not think, but just
answer this question right here, right now. you have
three seconds to answer this question.
which decision is it? which one do you choose?
answer it now for yourself. which one? see what
answer comes up. what's the first thing that came
to your mind? if you have to choose this or this,
which one is it? see how that feels.
how are you feeling? you might be feeling scared
that you made that decision. but i want you to
trust this practice, because sometimes if you give
yourself three seconds to decide that is the truth.
feel into that for a moment too. fee' into what that
feels like. feel if it's connected to you. sit with it.
you don't have to push it, you don't have to move it
forward. you can sit with it for 24 hours. but giving
yourself the opportunity to just answer with three
seconds, "okay, it's this." that is always the truth
that's coming through.
i feel like whenever i'm overthinking, my ego's
getting in the way. and when we answer without
hesitation, we allow our truthful voice to come
forward. so sit with the answer you got. give yourself
24 hours. maybe you feel really connected to it
right here, right now. trust that what comes through
without any pressure, without any drama. just in
three seconds, you have the opportunity to really
listen to your inner guide.
this is your three-second rule.
