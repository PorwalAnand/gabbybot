can't sleep
transcript
hello, my friend. oh, you're having trouble sleeping.
that's the worst. ilm sorry. i've been there. i've really
been there, and that's why i've 80t a lot of tools
right up my sleeve that really help me, really help
me.
the most valuable practice i have found for getting
to sleep is a breath practice that i do actually lying
down in my bed. make sure the lights are dim, that
your notifications are off. get comfortable in your
bed. let your body adjust so that you feel nothing
but complete comfort.
place your hand on your heart and your other hand
on your belly and breathe in for two strokes through
your nose, out for one stroke through your mouth.
and this is what it will sound like. do it with me now.
two quick strokes and through your nose. one long
breath out.
continue this cycle of breath. allow yourself to
relax. feel into that presence in your body. keep
going with this gentle breath. breathing in two
strokes, quickly out one throu8h your mouth.
continue this cycle of breath as you relax deeper
and deeper into your bed, trusting that this breath
practice is releasing any stress, any anxiety, any
fear. it's safe to let 80 now, safe to relax.
continue to breathe in for two, out for one, relaxing
your body more and more. take a deep breath in
and let it 80. let your body just settle into the bed.
you're safe. you're in your bed now relaxing. just let
go. let go.
