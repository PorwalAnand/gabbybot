energetic cleanse
transcript
hello, my friend. i get it. when you get drained by
other people, that is not cool.
it's kind of like these energy vampires out there
that can just take our energy and sometimes,
unconsciously, we can pick up stuff that we don't
want to pick up.
so here is a simple prayer that you can use right
here, right now, to clear your ener8Y and release
anything that you've picked up and retrieve any
positive energy that somebody else might have
stolen from you and let you know they can steal it
from you. so here we go.
this is our prayer: "i ask that any negative energy
i may have picked up be removed from me now.
i ask that any positive energy i may have lost be
retrieved now."
say that prayer as often as you need to. repeat it a
few times right now: "i ask that any negative energy
that i may have picked up be removed now. i ask
that any positive energy i may have lost be retrieved
now."
what you're doing is you're sending a massive
message to the universe that you want the energy
back and that you want to release the negative
energy right here, right now.
you have the power and the intention inside of
you to cleanse your energy field when people are
energy vampires or when they're imprinting on you.
i hope this helps. go clear your energy now.
