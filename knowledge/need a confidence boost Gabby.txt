transcript
all right, my friend. i see you. i've 80t you. you need
a confidence boost right now. maybe you're off to a
date or a new iob interview, whatever it is. let's get
you confident right here, right now.
stand up. i want you to stand up. stand up and
get your body into wonder woman or superman
pose. get into a super strong stance with your legs
shoulder width apart and put your hands on your
hips. roll your shoulders back, lift your chin up
slightly, and just allow yourself to settle into this
pose, this power pose. settle into the feelings that
arise as you stand in this posture.
this pose is so powerful for raising your inner
strength and your confidence. studies even
show that just being in this pose can boost your
self-confidence and even change your hormone
levels, so stand here in this pose right now.
feel into it. feel your body shift. feel your heart
open. feel that confidence come over you. close
your eyes and just let my voice guide you. i want
you to see yourself right now in that stance of
confidence, showing up for whatever it is that you
want to do, whatever it is that you want to create,
whoever it is that you want to be. assume this
energy now. feel it in your body. claim it in your
heart.
stay in the stance for as long as you want. feel
that feeling and bring it with you wherever you go.
you've 80t this, my friend.
