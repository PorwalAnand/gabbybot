need a miracle
transcript
hi, my friend. you just tapped on a button that said,
need a miracle. so ilm sure that there's somethin8
coming up for you right now where you just need
some serious help.
i want you to understand that your desire to even
tap this button is a message to the universe. you
have already said, "there has to be a better way.
i need some help. i need a miracle." so you're
already on your way. just putting that out there
sets the universe in motion. it sets you up to start
to become more receptive to solutions rather than
problems.
those simple words, there has to be a better way, i
need a miracle, it's a prayer. asking for a miracle
opens you up to creative solutions. saying this
prayer, this simple prayer, i need a miracle, is
enough. you're placing your faith in the universe
and you're taking this as an opportunity to rely on
the support and guidance that is around you and
the intuition that is within you. you have already, my
friend made the shift.
so i want you to just throughout the day say, "thank
you, universe for presenting me with this miracle
moment. thank you universe for presenting me with
this shift in my perception."
a miracle is simply a shift in perception. so
continue over and over to just thank the universe
for revealing your miracle to you, and then iust stay
open, stay receptive, trust that you've already done
the work, you've already done the work, you've
asked for help. ask and it is given. stay in that
prayer, "thank you universe for presenting me with
my miracle."
pay attention to all the miracles that unfold today.
