struggling With food

struggling with food?
hi, my friend. i am no stranger to overeating. for
many years, i would binge-eat just to try to stay
safe, to numb out my feelings, particularly around
holidays or times where i would get really kicked
up. and i found that one of the greatest tools for
me was a mindfulness practice of just turning
to a prayer before i eat, when i'd notice myself
overeating, when i'd notice myself afterwards
feeling guilty for overeating. i would gently take a
deep breath and say, "i love my food, my food loves
me."
i learned this in a yoga teacher training. i was sitting
on the floor in the yoga mat and i was stressing
out about my food, and the young woman next to
me said, "let's do a prayer. i love my food, my food
loves me." i took that with me, i carry it with me
wherever i 80. and now it's yours. in the moments
where you're overeating or in the moments when
you're sitting down to a meal, or if you feel anxious
around the food, say that prayer. "i love my food,
my food loves me. remember to breathe, remember
to chew, and repeat that prayer. "i love my food, my
food loves me."
