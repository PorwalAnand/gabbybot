want to keep manifesting?
okay, my friend. you're manifesting. you've got a
lot of super attractor mojo coming in, and maybe
there's a little voice in the back of your mind that's
like, how do i keep this going, or a voice of doubt.
can i keep this going? first, i want to answer you
with a loud hell yes. you can. you can keep your
manifesting going, and the secret to keeping your
manifesting going, keeping up the momentum,
is to feel into the feelings of what it is that you're
manifesting.
right here, right now, wherever you are, gently
close your eyes. place your hand on your heart. if
you're driving, of course we will do this later, but
if you are in a place that's comfortable for you,
close your eyes. put your hand on your heart, and
i want you to visualize for a moment the desire
that you are manifesting. see yourself in that
situation. see yourself having that experience. now
feel the feeling of what you see. for 20 seconds,
feel into that feeling. where is it in your body? is
it expansive? is it joyful? feeling into that feeling
more deeply now, harnessing the joy and the
excitement and the love and the appreciation that
comes through. feel into the feeling. notice how that
makes you feel. tap into it, and trust that this brief
encounter with that feeling is how you manifest.
come back to this get gabby whenever you want to
activate the momentum of your manifestation, and
remember when i tell you this, you can keep the
manifesting momentum going because manifesting
is the truth of who you are. attracting what you
desire is your true nature. keep it up. keep coming
back to this. return to it every day if you need a little
reminder. feel into the feeling and let it expand.
